# Viterbi-algorithm
My own Viterbi algorithm code. Adapted from Biological sequence analysis book by Durbin R., Eddy S.R., Krogh A., Mitchison G

Simulate throws with a loaded and a fair die. Afterwards tries to predict which die produced each throw. Produces a CSV file containing correct die and estimated die.

Also makes a plot illustrating the correctness of the estimation. Green indicates that viterbi correclty guessed loaded (hard). Red indicates that viterbi didn't detect loaded. Blue indicates that viterbi guessed loaded even though it wasn't. Everywhere else, both are fair.
