# Viterbi-algorithm
My own Viterbi algorithm code. Adapted from Biological sequence analysis book by Durbin R., Eddy S.R., Krogh A., Mitchison G

Simulate throws with a loaded and a fair die. Afterwards tries to predict which die produced each throw. Produces a CSV file containing correct die and estimated die. Also makes a plot illustrating the correctness of the estimation.
